# Clarke-Wright-greedy-heuristic-for-TSP
Project I - Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures

This was done as a project in graduate course Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures.
In this project I implemented Clarke-Wright heuristic, which is also known as saving heuristics  and tested it against various inputs. 
Results are shown in documentation. In documentation core of this heuristic is briefly explained. Main part of the code provided here was developed 
by teaching assistant. As I have started this project late (late compared to the deadline) my implementetion is O(n^3), but it should be easy to modify it to O(n^2*logn).
